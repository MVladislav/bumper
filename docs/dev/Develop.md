# Development Guide

This guide covers setting up a local development environment, running the application, and maintaining code quality.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

-   Python 3.13.x installed
-   Git

---

## 🛠️ Setup Local Environment

**Step 1 – Clone the repository**

```sh
$git clone https://github.com/MVladislav/bumper.git
$cd bumper
```

**Step 2 – Create and activate virtual environment, install uv**

```sh
$python3 -m venv .venv
$source .venv/bin/activate
$python3 -m pip install uv
```

**Step 3 – Install project dependencies**

```sh
$uv sync --all-groups --upgrade
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Application

```sh
$./scripts/create_cert.sh
$WEB_SERVER_HTTPS_PORT=8443 uv run bumper
```

The web UI will be available at `https://127.0.1.1:8443` by default.

## ✅ Code Quality and Testing

### Linting & Static Analysis

**Run pre-commit hooks**

```sh
$pre-commit run --all-files
```

**Type checking with mypy**

```sh
$uv run --frozen mypy bumper/
```

**Linting with pylint**

```sh
$uv run --frozen pylint bumper/
```

### Unit Tests

**Run tests**

```sh
$uv run pytest tests
```

**Tests with coverage report**

```sh
$uv run pytest --cov=./ tests --cov-report xml --junitxml=pytest-report.xml
```

**Generate HTML coverage report**

```sh
$uv run pytest --cov=./ tests --cov-report html:tests/report
```

The HTML report is located at `tests/report/index.html`.
