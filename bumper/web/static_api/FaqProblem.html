    Bumper FAQ: Frequently Annoying Questions 🤖❓
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Q: My robot just spun in a circle, beeped twice, and then sulked under the
    couch. Why?
  </h3>
  <p>
    A: It probably sensed your energy. Or it detected a ghost. Hard to say. Try
    rebooting... or burning sage.
  </p>

  <h3>Q: Does Bumper work offline?</h3>
  <p>
    A: Yes! In fact, Bumper *only* works offline. If it starts working online,
    please unplug everything and run.
  </p>

  <h3>Q: Is my data safe?</h3>
  <p>
    A: Safer than your group chat. Bumper stores everything locally, where only
    you (and maybe your cat) can see it.
  </p>

  <h3>Q: I yelled at the robot and now it won't clean. Help?</h3>
  <p>
    A: Apologize gently. Maybe offer it a microfiber cloth or a firmware update
    as a peace offering.
  </p>

  <h3>Q: How do I contact support?</h3>
  <p>
    A: You are the support. Check the logs, the docs, or the stars. And if all
    else fails... just turn it off and on again.
  </p>
