    <h3>Q: My robot just spun in a circle, beeped twice, and then sulked under the couch. Why?</h3>
    <p>A: It probably sensed your energy. Or it detected a ghost. Hard to say. Try rebooting... or burning sage.</p>

    <h3>Q: Does Bumper work offline?</h3>
    <p>A: Yes! In fact, Bumper *only* works offline. If it starts working online, please unplug everything and run.</p>

    <h3>Q: Is my data safe?</h3>
    <p>A: Safer than your group chat. Bumper stores everything locally, where only you (and maybe your cat) can see it.</p>

    <h3>Q: I yelled at the robot and now it won't clean. Help?</h3>
    <p>A: Apologize gently. Maybe offer it a microfiber cloth or a firmware update as a peace offering.</p>

    <h3>Q: How do I contact support?</h3>
    <p>A: You are the support. Check the logs, the docs, or the stars. And if all else fails... just turn it off and on again.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; margin-top: 2em;">
        Still have questions? Perfect. So do we. But somehow, things mostly work. üéâ
